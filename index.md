## About

I am a statistician at the Yale School of Nursing. I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Connecticut in 2025. My research focuses on Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo computation, with applications to longitudinal and multivariate models, as well as microbiome and multi-omics data analysis.

## Current Research

- **Marginal likelihood estimation** for complex Bayesian models, including
  efficient Monte Carlo–based methods.

- **Marginal likelihood decomposition in randomized controlled trials**, with an
  emphasis on separating mean and covariance structures in longitudinal data.

- **Microbiome and multi-omics trajectory analysis**, studying how temporal
  changes in microbial and functional profiles are associated with clinical and
  neurodevelopmental outcomes.
