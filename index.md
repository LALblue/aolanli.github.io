## About

I am a statistician at the Yale School of Nursing. My research focuses on Bayesian
inference and Monte Carlo computation, with applications to longitudinal and
multivariate models, as well as microbiome and multi-omics data analysis.

## Current Research

- **Marginal likelihood estimation** for complex Bayesian models, including
  efficient Monte Carlo–based methods.

- **Marginal likelihood decomposition in randomized controlled trials**, with an
  emphasis on separating mean and covariance structures in longitudinal data.

- **Microbiome and multi-omics trajectory analysis**, studying how temporal
  changes in microbial and functional profiles are associated with clinical and
  neurodevelopmental outcomes.
